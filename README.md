### ‚ôªÔ∏è Project Workflows

1. **Data Collection:** Gathered data from the HTML structure of the course's website.
2. **Script Development:** Developed Python scripts responsible for parsing HTML and extracting essential data required for subsequent requests.
3. **HTTP Requests:** Performed a series of Http GET requests to the website to obtain session resources, particularly video sessions in the current implementation.
4. **Testing:** Implemented a suite of tests for the [`course_parser.py`](./src/course_parser.py) script to ensure robust and reliable HTML parsing.
5. **Data Structure Maintenance:** Maintained the integrity and structure of the acquired data and resources, ensuring they are ready for presentation on a web page.
6. **Documentation and Presentation:** Utilized `mkdocs` along with the `mkdocs-material` theme/extension to seamlessly generate a professional-looking web page.
7. **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):** Employed **Github Actions** to automate the build and deployment processes, ensuring the web page is always up-to-date.
8. **Web Hosting:** Leveraged **Github Pages** as a reliable hosting solution to make the web page accessible to a wider audience.

By following these workflows, the project ensures efficient data extraction, robust testing, proper documentation, and automated deployment, ultimately resulting in a well-maintained and accessible web page hosted on Github Pages.
